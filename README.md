# Learning-Hibernate-framework
This is a maven project of maven-archetype-quickstart archetype. 
It depicts a basic inventory database and manipulating the said database purely using hibernate and HQL.
It is not an api and lacks connection to front-end so all inputs are provided from the 'main (String [] args)' method in App.java.
